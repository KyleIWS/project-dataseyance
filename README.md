# data-seyance: Possible directions

## 1.  The Effect of Amazon on a City.  
Amazon recently started looking for a second HQ. We want to figure out the pros and cons of having a company with tens of thousands of employees.This may vary from short term effects like strain on public transport to long term effects like overall prosperity or gentrification.

Amazon hires about 40,000 people across 8 million sq. feet in Seattle, and itâ€™s growth is not sustainable for the city. We have a lot of data to see the impact of such a company. We have data like average salaries and increases in cost of living. We can study the effect on gentrification, homelessness, Seattle tech industry etc. 
 
Compare growth rates and progress markers for Amazon employees vs. those for the city. We could compare the effect of Amazon to that of Microsoft. While similar in scale, Microsoft is known for being cognizant of city infrastructure and setting up shop outside of the city. This is crucial in understanding the urban sprawl and development of Seattle. There might also be overall economic benefits. 

Once we develop a better understanding of the effects of such a workforce, we can find better suited cities for the company. It should also provide meaningful insights into the mechanisms behind gentrification and fostering a tech industry.
